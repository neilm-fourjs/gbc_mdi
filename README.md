# GBC MDI Customisation

This customisation was down to show an application using 'tabbed MDI' with a 'startMenu' displayed down the left hand side.


## Folders
* gbc-mdi : The files for the custom GBC
* Screenshots : The screenshots for this README


## Building
This was written and tested on Linux. The Makefile and Script are to setup additional folders and to build the GBC.
* 1. The GBC prerequisites building ( grunt nodejs git ) plus: make & zip installed
* 2. Set GBCPROJECTDIR=<folder containing fjs-gbc-1.00.53-build201905131540-project.zip>
* 3. or create a symlink of gbc-current that points to your unzipper gbc project download.
 
```
$ git clone <repo url>
$ cd <folder cloned>
$ make
```
